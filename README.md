# DogCatsCNN

In this project we'll try to predict if an animal is a dog or a cat based on a database storing 25000 training images of dogs and cats. 

You can find the related datset on Kaggle :

To do so, I've choosed to build CNNs in order to predict dog and cats. 

Here is the link of the colab notebook :

This dataset comes from a competition and the prediction results we're not given. So I decided to split the train set to 2 subsets : train and validation and use the validation set as the test set.
